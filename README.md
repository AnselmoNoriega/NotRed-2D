# Not-Red 2D Engine 🚀
Not-Red 2D is a 2D game engine built to provide a Unity-like workflow for 2D game development. It’s powered by OpenGL and comes with everything you need to create and serialize 2D physics-based games with sprite rendering.

## 🌟 Features
🎮 2D Physics: Integrate realistic 2D physics to bring interactive gameplay to life.
🖼️ Sprite Rendering: Leverage OpenGL-powered rendering for smooth 2D graphics.
💾 Project Serialization: Easily save and load project data to resume or deploy games.
🛠️ Unity-Like Workflow: Familiar, intuitive setup to help Unity users get started quickly.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup
1. Generate Project Files
   To set up the project, first:
   - Run the batch file: 'NotRed\Scripts\Win-GenProj.bat'
   - Once the files are generated, open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. Create a New Project in the Editor
   To start a new project:
   - Run the project, and it will prompt you to open an .nrproj file.
   - Select the provided empty project file ('NotRed\NotEditor\SandboxProject\Sandbox.nrproj')
This 'Sandbox.nrproj' file is a base project to help you get started with Not-Red 2D.

## 🚀 Getting Started
🧩 Scene Setup: Organize 2D game objects in your scene.
🏗️ Physics Components: Attach physics to objects to add motion and interactions.
🌈 Sprite Importing: Import and assign sprites to objects for visuals.
📂 Save/Load Projects: Use built-in serialization to save project states for easy resuming and deployment.
